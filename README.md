üîç Search Algorithm Highlights
Our search functionality is designed for a highly intuitive user experience:

Normalization: All search queries and product titles are normalized (converted to lowercase, punctuation removed, extra spaces trimmed) to ensure consistent matching.

Tiered Scoring:

100% Match: If the user's search query (after normalization) is an exact phrase match within a product title.

Partial Match: If no exact 100% match is found, products are scored based on how many of their individual title words are present in the search query. Shorter, more relevant titles with matching words will score higher, ensuring the best partial matches appear first.
